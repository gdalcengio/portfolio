                <p>Resurgence is a mid-core, puzzle platforming game my team and I created for advanced game design course project. We kept weekly updates that one can view <a href="">here</a> or <a href="">here</a> for my individual updates. </p>

                <h3>process</h3>
                <p>We began by exploring the different genres and ideas for games that we could make. We decided on the idea of a character being able to travel through electric current or water. This was scrapped after brainstorming and fleshing out the idea further. We agreed on a puzzle game involving two characters, one with abilities based on the element of earth and one of water. We then started expirementing with the main characters, fine tuning their physics and abilities until they felt fluid. The first issue that arose was how to deal with and maintain physics between the player, their abilities and objects. Through weeks of iteration and bug testing we (finish this tomorrow gabe) </p>
