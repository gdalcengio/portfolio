                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>Resurgence is a mid-core, puzzle platforming game my team and I created for advanced game design
                    course project. It was meant to be a fun, cooperative experience supporting two controllers for each
                    player. Only through working together can the two players defeat the final boss and save the world
                    from pollution. </p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>We began by exploring the different genres and ideas for games that we could make. We decided on the
                    idea of a
                    character being able to travel through electric current or water. This was scrapped after
                    brainstorming and fleshing
                    out the idea further. We agreed on a puzzle game involving two characters, one with abilities based
                    on the element
                    of earth and one of water. We then started experimenting with the main characters, fine tuning their
                    physics and
                    abilities until they felt fluid. The first issue that arose was how to deal with and maintain
                    physics between the
                    player, their abilities and objects. Through weeks of iteration and bug testing we tweaked the
                    gameplay, then built
                    out levels, enemy behaviour, game structure and then the boss battle.</p>

                <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
                <p>I am very proud of the outcome. We've created a full, midcore video game from scratch in which two
                    people can
                    cooperate together and have a good time. Through this experience, I've gained further practice in
                    game design, User
                    Experience design, and logical programming management skills. Our team really focused on having this
                    game accessible
                    to a wide audience. For those who don't game as much, we needed to focus and heavily experiment with
                    tutorials and
                    interaction points. As this is the biggest project I've worked on from the start, I needed to
                    heavily organize it
                    constantly. Because of this organization, my programming teammate and I were able to consistently
                    work on production
                    with the least amount of code conflicts.</p>

                <p>We also kept weekly updates that one can view <a href="https://teampenne.wordpress.com"
