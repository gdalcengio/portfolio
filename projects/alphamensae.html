                <h3>context</h3>
                <p>As a retirement plan, my dad intends on building a publishing company. Being his son with web development skills, it only made sense that I create it. After sitting down with him and understanding what he wanted, I began to build a few mockups to get an idea of what direction to go. </p>

                <img src="../img/alphamensae_mockups.jpg" class="limit" alt="design mockups in figma">
                <figcaption>Early mockups exploring the overall theme.</figcaption>
                
                <h3>process</h3>
                <p>Once he was okay with the mockups, I began to build the website with very vanilla html and css, nothing new. I included a child directory with a completely italian version that the user can switch to as per his request. I also used this as an opportunity to practice mobile-first design.
                </p>
                
                <p>Once the website was done, I hooked up his GoDaddy domain to the AWS amplify service I was using to host his website. This was a first for me and went very smoothly, only taking about an hour. </p>
                
                <h3>what i've learned</h3>
                <p>Overall, my dad is very happy with the website so I’m content with it as well. This project took about 3 days and nothing went horribly wrong. I learned to connect a static IP address to a domain purchased via godaddy and I’ve refreshed my skills on basic static website building. I've also learned a lot in the process of receiving client feedback. During the development, I met with my dad a few times to discuss what needs changes and what he didn't like. This was an iterative process and by interpreting feedback preoperly, I satisfied my client's requests. </p>
