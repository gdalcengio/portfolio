                <h3>context</h3>
                <p>For a semester long final project, we were tasked to create a dynamic website using php, mySQL and AJAX technologies. Our requirements were that users must be able to sign up and sign in with encrypted passwords and that we displayed linkable cards from a list page. On this list page, the content cards must have a way to categorize initially and a way to filter further. Finally we were to document the ER diagram, coding process and features in the final report shown below.

                <!-- <h3>process</h3>
                <p>We began by exploring the different genres and ideas for games that we could make. We decided on the idea of a
                    character being able to travel through electric current or water. This was scrapped after brainstorming and fleshing
                    out the idea further. We agreed on a puzzle game involving two characters, one with abilities based on the element
                    of earth and one of water. We then started experimenting with the main characters, fine tuning their physics and
                    abilities until they felt fluid. The first issue that arose was how to deal with and maintain physics between the
                    player, their abilities and objects. Through weeks of iteration and bug testing we tweaked the gameplay, then built
                    out levels, enemy behaviour, game structure and then the boss battle.</p>

                <h3>what i've learned</h3>
                <p>I am very proud of the outcome. We've created a full, midcore video game from scratch in which two people can
                    cooperate together and have a good time. Through this experience, I've gained further practice in game design, User
                    Experience design, and logical programming management skills. Our team really focused on having this game accessible
                    to a wide audience. For those who don't game as much, we needed to focus and heavily experiment with tutorials and
                    interaction points. As this is the biggest project I've worked on from the start, I needed to heavily organize it
                    constantly. Because of this organization, my programming teammate and I were able to consistently work on production
                    with the least amount of code conflicts.</p>
