                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>SoSY Hackademia was a hackathon hosted on July 11th - 13th by SFU Software Systems Student Society. The focus of the hackathon was to make a website with the theme of ‘space’ in 2 days. </p>
                <p>My partner Alvin and I began to brainstorm project ideas. We landed on an interactive canvas where one can draw and have their drawing sent to a community space to follow the goals of web 2.0. Each drawing is part of an n-body physics simulation as if they were constellations in a solar system.  </p>

                <figcaption>Initial canvas to submit drawing constellation</figcaption>
                
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>As I was learning gcloud and using PHP for work, we decided on these technologies to create the project. In gcloud I set up an unnecessarily expensive compute engine with free trial credits to host the backend PHP code + save the user constellation/drawing. I also set up an SQL instance to hold the image names, image titles, and metadata attached. 
                </p>

                <p>The PHP code saved the HTML5 canvas as a jpg on submit of the initial page. The second page pulled all image data as a JSON object. From there, the javascript reads these objects, displays the pictures and moves them around in the n-body simulation. Alvin took care of all  the physics code.

                <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
                <p>We’re really happy with how well it turned out and had lots of fun making this. We ended up winning the Instructor's Vote with a $25 gift card per person. We successfully followed the theme and created a working project that everyone could enjoy and contribute to during the presentation.</p>

                <p>There isn't much still available with the lack of documentation, but this is the page of the hackathon <a href="https://devpost.com/software/const-elation" class="link">here</a>. In the future I will make much more of an effort to document each phase of the project. </p>
