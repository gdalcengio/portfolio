          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>
            SoSY Hackademia was a hackathon hosted on July 11th - 13th by SFU
            Software Systems Student Society. The focus of the hackathon was to
            make a website with the theme of ‘space’ in 2 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            My partner Alvin and I began to brainstorm project ideas. We landed
            on an interactive canvas where one can draw and have their drawing
            sent to a community space to follow the goals of web 2.0. Each
            drawing is part of an n-body physics simulation as if they were
            constellations in a solar system.
          </p>

            alt="final project"
            loading="lazy"
          />

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            As I was learning gcloud and using PHP for work, we decided on these
            technologies to create the project. In gcloud I set up an
            unnecessarily expensive compute engine with free trial credits to
            host the backend PHP code + save the user constellation/drawing. I
            also set up an SQL instance to hold the image names, image titles,
            and metadata attached.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../img/sql-console.jpg"

            alt="First working save of image title in SQL database"
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
          <p>
            The PHP code saved the HTML5 canvas as a jpg on submit of the
            initial page. The second page pulled all image data as a JSON
            object. From there, the javascript reads these objects, displays the
            pictures and moves them around in the n-body simulation. Alvin took
            care of all the physics code.
          </p>

            loading="lazy"
          />

          <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
          <p>
            We’re really happy with how well it turned out and had lots of fun
            making this. We ended up winning the Instructor's Vote with a $25
            gift card per person. We successfully followed the theme and created
            a working project that everyone could enjoy and contribute to during
            the presentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            There isn't much still available with the lack of documentation, but
            this is the page of the hackathon
            <a href="https://devpost.com/software/const-elation" class="link"
              >here</a
            >. In the future I will make much more of an effort to document each
            phase of the project.
