> A neat wrapper around Node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

Version 3 is out! Check out our blog post about it: [Chokidar 3: How to save 32TB of traffic every week](https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/)

## Why?

Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](https://brunch.io/)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/chokidar).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?

Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalize
