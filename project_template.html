        <h2>web based chip-8 emulator</h2>
        <h3>intro to software engineering final</h3>

        <h4>context</h4>
        <p>Chip-8 is an <span class="tooltip">interpreted<span class="tooltiptext">having the ability to execute instructions without compiling</span></span> programming language which was developed in the 70s to make programming games on micro computers like the TI... calculator easier. Our task was to create an emulator and two games for said emulator within our web browser and our requirements were up to my team to decide</p>
        <h4>my role</h4>
        <p>I was the project manager, designer and high level programmer within my group of 6. I set up and managed our project tools using git, slack, and trello (a kanban task board). I kept everyone on track through weekly meetings and occasional slack check ups. I also designed the interface iteratively throughout the stable releases. Through this interface design, I connected the virtual machine to display both pixels and all its details on the webpage</p>

        <h4>process</h4>
        <p>We began by understanding exactly what a chip-8 interpreter does. Wikipedia was a great source of this. We researched the ins and outs of each register, instructions, etc... We then went on to build the core of the project, created a webpage to display it, connected it to the webpage and ran into many bugs. We immediately had framerate issues and issues with the actual chip-8 instructions. The instructions were broken in many places and it took us about a month of debugging to the second release to finally get it working. We then added more information, cleaned more bugs and recreated both snake and flappy bird</p>

        <h4>what i've learned</h4>
        <p>Overall, I am very happy with the result of this project. I learned quite a bit, specifically in project and time management, javascript nuances (as I had minimal prior experience with javascript) and I practiced layout design. One of the things I struggled with the most was keeping two weaker teammates working and on track. I found that you should never discount them because they may have hidden skills that they are not even aware about. For example, our weakest member ended up creating the snake clone entirely on his own, making up for lack of work previously</p>
