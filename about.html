                <h2>Gabriele Dal Cengio</h2>
                <p>Hello, I’m a new graduate Software Engineer focusing on web technologies and game design. The people I’ve worked with call me a jack of all trades due to my broad knowledge and tenacity to complete a task well. Through the act of play, I aim to achieve lasting interactions between human and machine to make experiences effective.</p>
                <h2>Previous Position</h2>
                <p>
                    My last position was a remote position at Safe Software as a Back End Web Developer Co-op student on the Marketing Operations team. Here I mainly worked in PHP to update the twenty year old internal licensing tool and migrate it to a newer server. I additionally refreshed the design and included additional functionality for upcoming specialty licenses. This position was very gratifying to me as I was given opportunities to communicate with and learn from many other teams in the company.</p>
                <h2>Values</h2>
                <p>
                    I value comfort and making memorable life experiences. My hobbies include video games, plastic model building, experimenting with art and enjoying BC’s dynamic weather. My heritage is a mix of Italian and Chinese, inherently making inclusion and culture a large part of my life. I believe tradition should be embraced and shared because it makes life so much more interesting.
