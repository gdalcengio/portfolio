                <h2>Gabriele Dal Cengio</h2>
                <p>An imaginitive, jack of all programming trades with a focus in web technologies, game design and UI. Through the act of play, I aim to achieve lasting interactions between human and machine to both aid in learning and making experiences enjoyable and familiar.</p>

                <p>
                    I'm a young, full stack engineer ready to learn all the web has to offer me. My last position was a Junior Virtual Reality Developer at Virtro Entertainment working with Unity, the <span class="tooltip">LAMP stack<span class="tooltiptext">Linux|Apache|MySQL|PHP</span></span> and Mixed Reality Technologies. In this position I worked with a small team porting games to Virtual Reality, developing web apps and debugging/designing games within Virtual Reality. In my university career, I'm learning <span class="tooltip">design<span class="tooltiptext">focusing on Human Computer Interaction and User Interface Design</span></span>, low level <span class="tooltip">computing<span class="tooltiptext">Unix|C|Memory_Management</span></span>, game <span class="tooltip">design<span class="tooltiptext">Unity|Git|Maya|C#|User_Experience</span></span>, web design and <span class="tooltip">development<span class="tooltiptext">HTML|CSS|Javascript|Typography|Color</span></span>, relational database management, and <span class="tooltip">networking<span class="tooltiptext">in progress</span></span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time I like to play video games, build gundam figures and experiment with different forms of art. I value comfort and essential simplicity above all else, feeling most relaxed in quiet and peaceful environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being of both Italian and Chinese decent, culture and inclusion is a big part of my life. I try to embrace and integrate all the multicultural traditions that Canada offers us. I really believe that tradition is a connecting medium that needs to be embraced because of the plethora of knowledge and inspiration that is just waiting to be incorporated in everyday life. I intend to experience as much culture as I can and open myself to new ideas and inspirations as I go through life.
